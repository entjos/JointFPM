# JointFPM: A Parametric Model for Estimating the Mean Number of Events

Implementation of a parametric joint model for modelling recurrent and
competing event processes using generalised survival models as described
in Entrop et al., (2005)
[doi:10.1002/bimj.70038](https://doi.org/10.1002/bimj.70038) . The joint
model can subsequently be used to predict the mean number of events in
the presence of competing risks at different time points. Comparisons of
the mean number of event functions, e.g. the differences in mean number
of events between two exposure groups, are also available.
